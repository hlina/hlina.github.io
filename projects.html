                <p>Governments and health organizations frequently develop budgets that allocate available resources to different health-related expenditures, yet it is often challenging for officials to see how the resources would best be spent. For our Senior Design project, our team has built a website policy tool that helps users solve this resource allocation problem to optimally distribute resources over a network of cities to best contain the spread of epidemics.</p>

                <h4>Predicting World Populations</h4>
                <p>World overpopulation due to societal advances has always been a worry due to its implications for political policies, climate change, and natural resources. While historical models have worried about overpopulation, the 7th billion mark took an additional 13 years after the 6th billion, indicating the first decline in marginal growth. The UN currently predicts 9.6 billion for 2050 and 10.9 billion for 2100, with a large range of variability.  My model estimates 10.4 billion in 2050 and does not make predictions for 2100, knowing that uncertainty increases the further out the point is. </p>

                <p>The Intensive Care Unit's (PICU) system's work flow and key players were analyzed for sources of inefficiency. Since the unit is unpredictable and acuity is variably high, assigning patients and nurses to rooms in the PICU is a very important decision that can effect overall efficiency of resources and space. An app was designed to improve tasks that charge nurses, who are in charge of these decisions, have to perform. A prototype was tested on various charge nurses and a summary of results was presented to CHOP stakeholders. See a screenshot of the Prezi presentation to the left.</p>

They often have problems with bike distributions, as popular sations either get full from drop-offs or empty from pick-ups depending on the time of day.

Given constraints on delivery and size of delivering trucks, the model outputted the best route to deliver bikes to those needing to be rebalanced.</p>

                <p>There are two types of advertising: transformational and informational. Transformational advertising appeals to emotions, while informational advertising provides concrete descriptions of the product being sold. Data was gathered through online and in-person surveys. That data was analyzed using hypothesis testing. Sensitivity analysis like linear regression was done using JMP, a statistical software, and Python scripts. It was found that transformational advertising is more effective for older age groups. See the poster presented to the left.</p>
